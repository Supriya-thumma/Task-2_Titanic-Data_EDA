# ğŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ğŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of AI & ML Internship **Task 2** by Elevate Labs, focused on understanding the Titanic dataset through descriptive statistics and data visualizations.

## ğŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

## ğŸ›  Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## ğŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and reviewed summary statistics.
2. Created histograms for numerical features.
3. Created boxplots to detect outliers.
4. Generated a correlation heatmap for feature relationships.
5. Created a pairplot to visualize patterns between key variables.
6. Noted observations and patterns from the visuals.

## ğŸ“ˆ Output
- Visualizations for distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Insights into survival trends based on features like Pclass, Age, and Fare.
